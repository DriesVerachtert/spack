    """OCCA is an open-source (MIT license) library used to program current
       multi-core/many-core architectures. Devices (such as CPUs, GPUs,
       Intel's Xeon Phi, FPGAs, etc) are abstracted using an offload-model
       for application development and programming for the devices is done
       through a C-based (OKL) or Fortran-based kernel language (OFL).
       OCCA gives developers the ability to target devices at run-time by
       using run-time compilation for device kernels.
